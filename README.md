## Data Sources

A majority of the data is currently sourced from [r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). On the server side I use [spacelaunch-stats-server](https://github.com/vaneker/spacelaunch-stats-server) that utilized the Apollo GraphQL server middleware to increase performance by on the front-end by preventing unused API calls.

## Available Scripts
